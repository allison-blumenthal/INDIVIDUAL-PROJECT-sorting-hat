# The "Sorting Cat" [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/25ee64fb-f152-4ff5-90ef-4c07448d47ed/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/blumenthal-the-sorting-cat-project/deploys)


This project is a Harry Potter sorting hat dupe! Rather than sorting students, this app sorts users' cats! Click the first button to see the form, type your cat's name into the field, then sort your cat to receive a randomly assigned cat-house. Your cat will then have their own card and can be filtered by house along with any other entries you make. If you click "expel" on your cat's card, they will be sent to the Dark Side to join the army of "he who must not be named."

## Get Started 
$ git clone git@github.com:allison-blumenthal/INDIVIDUAL-PROJECT-sorting-hat.git

$ cd INDIVIDUAL-PROJECT-sorting-hat

## About the User 
- The ideal users for this application are cat owners with a love for all things Harry Potter
- If they have multiple cats, they can have fun seeing how their cats are randomly assigned to different houses, potentially matching their cats Potter-personalities.

## Features 
- The user is greeted with a fun graphic and must click the "let's get sorting" button to access the form for the app.
- When a new cat is added via the form, a card (object) is created with the cat's name and a random house assignment, added to an array of cats, and rendered to the DOM in the "house" section.
- The colorful house-labeled buttons allow the user to filter their cats by house.
- When a cat is expelled, that card is removed from the existing array and added The cat's house no longer shows as it is no longer relevant.
